# bookbot
Bookbot is my first git boot.dev project!

Script that counts number of words in a document, and number of occurrence, in a decreasing list, of each alphabetic character.

For use the def_path variable must be set with the absolute path of the input document.

Finally execute the main.py with the python interpreter in your CLI.
